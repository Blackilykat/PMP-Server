## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ THIS IS IN PRE-ALPHA! This means that it is unsecure, buggy, incomplete and likely to break over time. Do not use this if not for development and testing purposes until it reaches alpha.

# PMP-Server
This is the server for Personal Music Platform (that name is subject to change, I couldn't come up with anything better)

PMP is a platform that makes sure your library is synced across all devices. At least, that's its primary goal.

Everything is still in pre-alpha. Here's what that means:

|   Stage   | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:---------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-alpha | Not usable, insecure, likely to break over time (as the code changes without proper versions), lots of missing features                                                            |
|   Alpha   | Secure, may break between versions but there will be proper versions, usable, some core features still missing                                                                     |
|   Beta    | Usable, all core features are implemented, may break between versions, lots of bugs                                                                                                |
|  Release  | Usable, all core features are implemented, should not break between versions (retro-compatible server), minimal amount of bugs (can't aim for bug free because that's unrealistic) |

## Discord
I made a discord server for status and development updates, as well as discussions or suggestions about the project. Here's the invite link:
